# Rocksat-C_2016_GraphingUtility

Make sure you add R.Zip to the resources directory - too large to be stored on GIT. You can do so by simply downloading/installing
R and zipping the installation folder. I have not dived into see how small I could make the build.


The tool graphs the data from the RockSat-C CC-CO payload. It's a bit too specific as it is to work with any other data, but 
that should change over time.
