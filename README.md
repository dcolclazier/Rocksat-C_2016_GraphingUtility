Contact me if you want to contribute - you'll need some assets that are too large to include here. 

This is a slowly evolving data analysis and graphing utility. In its current state one can graph multiple curves from different csv files to the same graph with various options for labeling and coloring. It also has some basic image analysis software built in, but it is currently extremely specialized to analyze images from a RICH detector or other darkness-based charged particle impact detector.
